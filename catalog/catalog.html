      <b>catalog</b>,
      a C++ code which 
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77, FORTRAN90, MATLAB, Python, or R code 
      and prints every line that begins with a special index tag.  
      If the code has been marked up expecting this convention, 
      a handy table of contents will be created.
    </p>

    <p>
      catalog() only works if each routine has been marked in the 
      appropriate way.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C code, the necessary marker is '  Purpose:'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the line that comes two lines later, and assumes
      that the first 4 characters of that line are blank.
      <pre>
        void doodah ( int a, int b, int *c )
        
        /**********************************************************
        
          Purpose:
        
            DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C++ code, the necessary marker is '//  Purpose:'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the line that comes two lines later, and assumes
      that the first 6 characters of that line are to be ignored.
      <pre>
        void doodah ( int a, int b, int *c )
        
        //*********************************************************
        //
        //  Purpose:
        //
        //    DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        //
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>
 
    <p>
      For a FORTRAN77 code, the necessary marker is 'cc'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
              subroutine doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        c**********************************************************
        c
        cc DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        c
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a FORTRAN90 code, the necessary marker is '!!'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        subroutine doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        !**********************************************************
        !
        !! DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        !
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a MATLAB code, the necessary marker is '%%'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        function [ x, y ] = doodah ( a, b, c )
        
        %**********************************************************
        %
        %% DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        %
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a Python code, the necessary marker is '##'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        fdef = doodah ( a, b, c ):
        
        #**********************************************************
        #
        ## DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        #
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For an R code, the necessary marker is '##'.  <b>CATALOG</b>
      will print the remainder of any such line.  This marker must
      begin in column 1, and INDEX assumes that the third character
      is a blank, and ignores it.  I use the marker as follows:
      <pre>
        doodah <- function ( a, b, c )
        
        #**********************************************************
        #
        ## DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
        #
        ...(further text of the routine follows)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In each of the above cases, catalog() will extract and print the line
      <blockquote>
         DOODAH computes the mangletude of A hepcatted to B.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sample output of the program looks like this:
      <pre>

        The file is of FORTRAN type.

        Index of column.f90:

        COLUMN extracts a given column from a file.
        CHRCTI reads an integer from a string.
        CHRDB1 removes blanks from a string, left justifying the remainder.
        DIGTEN returns the integer value of a base 10 digit.
        WRDFND finds the word of a given index in a string.
        WRDNEXRD "reads" words from a string, one at a time.
      </pre>
