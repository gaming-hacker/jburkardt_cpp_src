      <b>nint_exactness_mixed_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls nint_exactness_mixed(), which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a multidimensional
      quadrature rule which is designed for a quadrature region that is
      a direct product of 1D regions which are a mixture of Legendre,
      Laguerre, and Hermite type regions.
