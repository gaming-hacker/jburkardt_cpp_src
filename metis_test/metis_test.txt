METIS_TEST
  C++ version
  Test the METIS library for graph partitioning.

PARTGRAPHRECURSIVE_TEST:
  METIS_PartGraphRecursive partitions a graph into K parts
  using multilevel recursive bisection.

  Return code = 1
  Edge cuts for partition = 3

  Partition vector:

  Node  Part

     0     0
     1     1
     2     1
     3     0
     4     0
     5     1

PARTGRAPHKWAY_TEST:
  METIS_PartGraphKway partitions a graph into K parts
  using multilevel K-way partition.

  Return code = 1
  Edge cuts for partition = 3

  Partition vector:

  Node  Part

     0     1
     1     1
     2     0
     3     1
     4     0
     5     0
