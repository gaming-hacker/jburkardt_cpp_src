  Given a PDE for which:
    C is the number of components of the solution
      at any single point,
    P is the number of points where a solution is given,
    N is the number of solution vectors,
    L is the number of modes to be extracted.

  Then we let M = C*P be the abstract spatial dimension.

  Set up A, the M by N matrix of solution vectors,

  Get A = U * S * V', the singular value decomposition.

  The first L columns of U are our modes.

  How many basis vectors (L) are to be extracted?

  L = 4

  You specify a consecutive sequence of file names
  by giving the first "base" file name.

  If there are no more sequences to enter,
  just hit RETURN.

  Enter a new base file name, or $ if done:

1:  "data01.txt"

  According to the first base file,
  The number of solution components C =   3
  The number of solution points P =       4
  The "size" of each solution M = (C*P) = 12
