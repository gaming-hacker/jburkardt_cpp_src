      <b>r8col_test</b>, 
      a C++ code which
      calls r8col(), which
      contains utility routines for "R8COL" objects, that is,
      double precision real MxN arrays, considered as N column vectors,
      each of length M.  That is, the data may be thought of as essentially
      multiple columns, and many operations will be carried out columnwise.
