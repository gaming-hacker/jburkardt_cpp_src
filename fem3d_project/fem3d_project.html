      FEM3D_PROJECT <br>  Project Data onto a 3D Finite Element Mesh
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM3D_PROJECT</b>,
      a C++ program which
      projects a finite element function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us suppose we have a region R and a "tet mesh" (tetrahedral mesh) of R, that is,
      a set of nodes N1 and tetrahedrons T1 whose union is R.  Let P1(I)(X,Y,Z)
      be the finite element basis function associated with node N1(I).
      Now let us suppose that we have a finite element function V1, that is
      a scalar- or vector-valued function V1(X,Y,Z) defined over R,
      with the formula
      <blockquote>
        V1(X,Y,Z) = sum ( 1 <= I <= NODE_NUM1 ) V1(I) * P1(I)(X,Y,Z)
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now suppose we have a second tet mesh of R comprising
      a set of nodes N2 and tetrahedrons T2.  Can we determine an appropriate
      set of finite element coefficients V2(I) which best approximate V1 in
      the finite element space defined by N2 and T2?  The finite element
      coefficient vector V2 is defined by the following relationship:
      <blockquote>
        Integral Sum ( 1 <= I <= NODE_NUM2 ) V2(I) P2(I)(X,Y,Z) P2(J)(X,Y,Z) dx dy dz
        = Integral V1(X,Y,Z) P2(J)(X,Y,Z) dx dy dz
      </blockquote>
      Thus, in particular, the function V1(X,Y,Z), which is defined on the first finite
      element space, must be evaluated in a computation that uses the second finite element
      space.
    </p>

    <p>
      This procedure can be used to determine the least squares approximant to
      data (actually, to the piecewise linear interpolant of that data) or to
      determine the finite element coefficients appropriate when recomputing
      a finite element solution from a fine mesh to a coarse mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sample data is given as three tables, each stored in a file:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <b>SAMPLE_NODES</b> file contains the 3D coordinates of sample points.
          Every sample point is presumed to lie within the area covered by the finite
          element mesh.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <b>SAMPLE_ELEMENTS</b> file contains the indices of nodes that
          form the elements.  The elements are presumed to be 4-node tetrahedrons
          that form a Delaunay tetrahedralization of the sample nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <b>SAMPLE_VALUES</b> file contains the value of some vector quantity
          V at each sample point.  The dimensionality of the V data is arbitrary.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The finite element mesh is given as two tables, each stored in a file:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <b>FEM_NODES</b> file contains the 3D coordinates of nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <b>FEM_ELEMENTS</b> file contains the indices of nodes that
          form the elements.  The elements are presumed to be 4-node tetrahedrons.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program produces a new table <b>FEM_VALUES</b>, of the same dimensionality
      as <b>SAMPLE_VALUES</b>.  The vector <b>FEM_VALUES</b> can be used in conjunction with
      the finite element mesh data to produce a finite element function that is
      an approximant to the <b>SAMPLE_VALUES</b> data.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>fem3d_project</b> <i>sample_prefix</i> <i>fem_prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>sample_prefix</i> is the common prefix for the SAMPLE files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>sample_prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,  the node coordinates (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,  the 4 nodes that make up each element (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_prefix</i><b>_values.txt</b>, the data values (input);
        </li>
      </ul>
      and <i>fem_prefix</i> is the common prefix for the FEM files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>fem_prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>fem_prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>, the 4 nodes that make up each element (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>fem_prefix</i><b>_values.txt</b>,   the data values (output).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The file <i>fem_prefix</i>_values.txt is created by the program, and contains
      the projections of the sample data values onto the finite element space, that is,
      these may be regarded as coefficients of finite element functions
      representing the projections of the sample data.  Note that we may also regard
      this operation as the refinement or coarsening of a finite element function,
      in that we are transferring information from the ``sample'' space to the ``fem''
      space.
