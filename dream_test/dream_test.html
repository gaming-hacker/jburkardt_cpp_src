      <b>PROBLEM1</b> is based on the first example in the Vrugt reference.
      The Vrugt version involves 100 variables, with a multidimensional
      normal distribution with specified mean vector and covariance matrix.
      So far, I have simply set up the user routines, with just 5 variables,
      and created a small stand-alone main program to test it.  An important
      issue was to find a simple and efficient way of handling the covariance.
      We need to evaluate the matrix, compute its Cholesky factor,
      find its determinant, just one time, and then provide this information
      to any function that needs it, quickly and simply.  In this version 
      of the code, I opted to define a "Covariance" structure, making it
      an "extern" variable so the main program could access it.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1.cpp">problem1.cpp</a>,
          is a user written file, containing the 5 functions required
          to define the problem data, as well as other functions to
          set the covariance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1.sh">problem1.sh</a>,
          runs the test.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_covariance.hpp">problem1_covariance.hpp</a>,
          an include file that defines the "Covariance" structure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_main.cpp">problem1_main.cpp</a>,
          a stand-alone main program that calls the user functions
          to make some simple tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_main.sh">problem1_main.sh</a>,
          runs the test.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_main.txt">problem1_main.txt</a>,
          the output file from the standalone main program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PROBLEM1C</b> is a version of PROBLEM1 that uses a class to store
      the covariance information, instead of a structure.  I didn't like
      this approach, since it seemed like, every time I needed some information,
      I had to call a function and provide an array to store a copy of the
      information, rather than simply accessing the information directly.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1c.cpp">problem1c.cpp</a>,
          is a user written file, containing the 5 functions required
