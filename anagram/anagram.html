      ANAGRAM <br> Generate Anagrams
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>ANAGRAM</b>,
      a C++ program which
      takes a string of letters
      and tries to produce as many anagrams as possible,
      by James Cherry.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>anagram</b> <i>letters</i> <i>[numbers]</i> <i>[suggested words]</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>letters</i>, a string of lower case letters, with no spaces, to be
          anagrammed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>[numbers]</i>, the optional <i>numbers</i> fields force the program 
          to look for
          anagrams that contain words of each length.  Up to ten word lengths
          may be specified.  This is useful when you have a very large number
          of letters (e.g., more than 20) that you wish to permute, and you
          wish for the program to skip over all the anagrams containing only
          short (three and four letter) words.  For example, when you are
          looking for anagrams of 30 letters, you might include the lengths
          "8 8 8" to force three of the words to be eight letters long each.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>[suggested words]</i>, the optional <i>suggested words</i> fields are taken one at a time,
          and they consist of lower case letters (a-z) only too; each set of
          these letters is removed from the original letters, and anagrams
          of the remaining letters are found.  This can be useful when you
          wish to find anagrams involving particular words or a proper name.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If no command line arguments are specified, you are prompted for
      the arguments; after the program has found all anagrams, it returns
      you to the prompt.
    </p>

      Usage Examples:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>anagram</b> <i>jamescherry</i><br>
           finds all anagrams of "jamescherry".
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>anagram</b> <i>jamescherry 5</i><br>
          forces at least one of the words to be 5 letters long.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>anagram</b> <i>jamescherry 6 5</i><br>
          forces one word to be 6 letters long and the other to be 5 long.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>anagram</b> <i>jamescherry charm</i><br>
          finds all anagrams where "charm" is one of the words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>anagram</b><br>
          enters interactive mode; then typing "jamescherry" at the prompt
          is the same as example 1, above.  Likewise "jamescherry 5" at
          the prompt is the same as example 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
