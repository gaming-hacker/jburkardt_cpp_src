      TEST_LLS <br> Linear Least Squares Test Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_LLS</b>,
      a C++ code which
      implements linear least squares (LLS) test problems 
      which seek a vector x which minimizes the error in the
      rectangular linear system A*x=b.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some linear least squares problems include constraints on the data,
      such as requiring that every entry of X be positive.  This library
      only contains unconstrained problems.  For such problems, the task is
      typically to find a vector X which minimizes the Euclidean norm of
      the residual r=Ax-b, or, in cases where multiple minimizers exist,
      to find the minimizer of minimal Euclidean norm.
    </p>

    <p>
      TEST_LLS requires access to a compiled copy of the R8LIB library.
