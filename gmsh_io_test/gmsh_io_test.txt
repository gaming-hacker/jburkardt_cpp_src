GMSH_IO_TEST
  C++ version
  Test the GMSH_IO library.

TEST01:
  Get example 2D data, write to a file.

  Number of nodes = 21
  Spatial dimension = 2
  Number of elements = 24
  Order of elements = 3

  Coordinates for first 10 nodes:

  Row:       0             1       
  Col

    0:             0             0
    1:             1             0

MESH_BASE_ONE:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  No conversion is necessary.

  Wrote example data to file "example_2d.msh"

TEST02:
  Read data from a file.

  Node data read from file "example_2d.msh"
