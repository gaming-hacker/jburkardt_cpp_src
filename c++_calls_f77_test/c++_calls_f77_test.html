      <b>c++_calls_f77_test</b>,
      C++ programs which
      illustrates how a C++ main program can call a FORTRAN77 subroutine.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this example, the KRONROD package is used.  Note that the KRONROD
      library is available in C++ and in FORTRAN77, so this example is not
      created out of necessity (the C++ main program could have simply called
      the C++ version of KRONROD).  Instead, it is intended as an example of
      how to do this when you have to (you don't have a C++ version of the
      routines you want to use.)
    </p>

    <p>
      When calling a FORTRAN77 routine from a C++ function, there are
      some simple things that may be enough to guarantee success.
      <ul>
        <li>
          a FORTRAN77 subroutine is like a C++ void function, and should
          be declared this way in the C++ code.  The qualifier <b>extern</b>
          should also be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          a FORTRAN77 subroutine or function expects all its arguments
          to be passed by reference.  This generally means simply that
          the C++ function must pass scalar variables by reference, not value.
        </li>
        <li>
          typically, when the FORTRAN77 compiler compiles the FORTRAN77
          code, the names of functions and subroutines are stored with
          an appended underscore.  In order for these names to be found
          by the C++ code, it is necessary that the C++ code declare and
          invoke the FORTRAN functions and subroutines with the underscore
          explicitly appended to the name.
        </li>
        <li>
          in many cases, a FORTRAN compiler is simply a "front end" to a
          corresponding C++ compiler, as in the case of the GNU compilers
          gfortran and g++, or the Intel compilers ifort and icpp.  This means
          that, as long as the corresponding compilers are used to compile
          the FORTRAN77 and C++ codes, it is probably possible to use either
          compiler to link and load the object codes; however, the load
          command may need to specify explicitly certain libraries associated
          with one of the languages.  For instance, if loading using the
          gcc command, it is necessary to include "-l gfortran" so that
          the FORTRAN I/O libraries, among others, are included in the build.
        </li>
      </ul>
