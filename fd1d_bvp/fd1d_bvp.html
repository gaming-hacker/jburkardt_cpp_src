      FD1D_BVP <br>
      Finite Difference Method<br>
      1D Boundary Value Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_BVP</b>,
      a C++ program which
      applies the finite difference method to solve
      a two point boundary value problem in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boundary value problem (BVP) that is to be solved has the form:
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( a(x) * du/dx ) + c(x) * u(x) = f(x)
      </pre>
      in the interval X[0] &lt; x &lt; X[N-1].  The functions a(x), c(x), and f(x) are
      given functions, and a formula for a'(x) is also available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boundary conditions are applied at the endpoints, and in this case,
      these are assumed to have the form:
      <pre>
        u(X[0]) = 0.0;
        u(X[N-1]) = 0.0.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute a finite difference approximation, a set of n
      nodes is defined over the interval, and, at each interior node,
      a discretized version of the BVP is written, with u''(x) and u'(x)
      approximated by central differences.
