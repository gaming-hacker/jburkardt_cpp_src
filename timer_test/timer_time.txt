TIMER_TIME
  C++ version
  Demonstrate the use of the TIME real time timer.

  TIME is a standard C++ library routine
  (defined in <ctime>)

  It returns a reading of the number of seconds on a clock.
  Taking the difference between two such readings
  can give a real time measurement.  However, this measurement
  is no finer than one second.

TEST01
  Time the RAND function by computing N values.
  For a given N, repeat the computation 5 times.

  Data vectors will be of minimum size 1
  Data vectors will be of maximum size 16777216

  CPU times are in seconds.
