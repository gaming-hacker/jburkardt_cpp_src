FEM2D_PROJECT
  C++ version.

  Read files defining a sampling of a function of 2 arguments.
  Read files defining a finite element mesh.
  Project the sample data onto the mesh, and
  write a file of FEM coefficient values.

  Sample node spatial dimension is 2
  Sample node number is            81

  Sample element order is  3
  Sample element number is 128

  Converting 1-based sample element array to 0 base.

  The sample value dimension is    3
  The sample value number is        81

  The element neighbor array has been computed.

  The FEM node dimension is        2
  The FEM node number is           25
  The FEM element order is         3
  The FEM element number is        32

  Converting 1-based FEM element array to 0 base.

  FEM value data written to "fem_values.txt"

FEM2D_PROJECT
  Normal end of execution.
