      ROT13 <br> Apply "ROT13" Transformation to a File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ROT13</b>,
      a C++ code which
      reads a file and makes a
      copy in which all characters have been "rotated" by 13 positions, and
      all digits have been "rotated" by 5 positions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applying ROT13 to the transformed file returns the original.
      Thus, ROT13 can be used as a very simply method of encoding
      and decoding text files.  Only an idiot would be fooled by this
      encoding, but nonetheless the encoding serves a number of useful
      purposes.  And often, it's only idiots you have to fool, after all.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>rot13</b> <i>file1.txt</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>file1.txt</i> is the input file to be encoded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The output filename is the ROT13 transformation of the input filename.
      In the case of "file1.txt", the output filename would be <i>svyr6.gkg</i>.
