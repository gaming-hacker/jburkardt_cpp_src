    <p>
      <b>complex_numbers_test</b>,
      a C++ program which
      demonstrates some of the features of using complex
      numbers in a C++ program. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of single precision or double precision, whether
      the variable is a scalar, vector, or array, and whether the variable
      is initialized with a value, or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  Moreover, it is occasionally true
      that there may be a selection of functions with similar names
      (say, "exp", "cexp" and "dcexp") which may or may not produce the
      desired results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  Thus, it sometimes really matters whether
      you use "cmplx" or "dcmplx" to assign values to a double precision
      complex variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      An unusual feature of the C++ implementation of complex numbers is that
      "complex &lt;float&gt;" and "complex &lt;double&gt;" are not as easily
      used as an ordinary type when trying to "cast" values.  That is, 
      it may be very tempting to try to assign a complex value with a 
      statement such as
      <blockquote>
        a = ( complex &lt;double&gt; ) ( 1.0, 2.0 );  (illegal!)
      </blockquote>
      but this is wrong because (1.0,2.0) is not a legitimate numeric type
      that is to be converted to another type, which is what a cast operator
      requires.  The statement, unfortunately,
      is not necessarily illegal, so the compiler won't warn you, and my compiler
      will actually end up setting <b>a</b> to 2, which is not what I
      wanted at all.  The correct assignment is
      <blockquote>
        a = complex &lt;double&gt; ( 1.0, 2.0 );
      </blockquote>
      and you can read this as a call to a function whose arguments are
      the real and imaginary parts of the desired result.  People who are
      used to the idea that parentheses never hurt should take note of
      this counterexample!
    </p>

    <p>
      A second, and more peculiar, feature to me is that it seems as though
      the complex numbers created in C++ cannot easily interoperate with
      the real and integer values.  In particular, assuming the declaration
      <blockquote>
        a = complex &lt;double&gt; ( 1.0, 2.0 );
      </blockquote>
      my compiler complained about statements like these:
      <pre>
        a = a + 1; (illegal!)
        a = a * 4; (illegal!)
        a = a / 8; (illegal!)
        a = 1 / a; (illegal!)
        a = pow ( 2, a ); (illegal!)
        a = pow ( 2.1, a ); (illegal!)
      </pre>
      all of which became legal when I replaced the arithmetic operands
      by corresponding complex &lt;double&gt; variables of the same value.
    </p>

    <p>
      A third peculiarity of the C++ version of complex numbers is that the
      function <b>norm ( z )</b> is stated to return
      <i>the norm of the complex number <b>z</b></i>, but in fact,
      returns the <i>square</i> of the norm of the number.  The use of the word
      "norm" is a misuse, since the norm has a commonly accepted mathematical
      definition as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
      real and imaginary parts.  Thus, the C++ function returns the "norm" of 4+4i 
      as 32 whereas the norm of 4+4i is sqrt(32).  As ever in computer languages,
      once a bad choice is made, it's never rescinded.  Be prepared for
      needless and inevitable confusion, though, when using this function.
