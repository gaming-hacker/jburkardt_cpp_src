ASA314_TEST:
  C++ version
  Test the ASA314 library.

TEST01
  INVMOD computes the inverse of a matrix
  whose elements are subject to modulo arithmetic.

  The matrix to be inverted:

  Col:       0       1       2
  Row

    0:       1       1       2
    1:       0       1       0
    2:       0       0       1

  The computed inverse:

  Col:       0       1       2
  Row

    0:       1       2       1
    1:       0       1       0
    2:       0       0       1

  The correct inverse:

  Col:       0       1       2
  Row

    0:       1       2       1
    1:       0       1       0
    2:       0       0       1
