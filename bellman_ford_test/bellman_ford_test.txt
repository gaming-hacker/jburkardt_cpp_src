BELLMAN_FORD_TEST
  C++ version
  Test the BELLMAN_FORD library.

TEST01:
  Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.

  Number of vertices = 6
  Number of edges = 10
  The reference vertex is 0

  The edge array:

  Row:      0       1  
  Col

    0:     1       0  
    1:     4       1  
    2:     1       2  
    3:     2       4  
    4:     4       0  
    5:     2       5  
    6:     5       0  
    7:     3       2  
    8:     5       3  
    9:     3       0  

  The edge weights:

         0:             -3
         1:              6
         2:             -4
         3:             -1
         4:              4
         5:             -2
         6:              2
         7:              8
         8:             -3
         9:              3

  The shortest distances:

         0:              0
         1:             -6
         2:             -2
         3:              3
         4:              0
         5:              0

  The vertex predecessor parents for the shortest paths:

         0:       -1
         1:        2
         2:        5
         3:        0
         4:        1
         5:        3
