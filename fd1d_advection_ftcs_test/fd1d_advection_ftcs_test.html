      <b>fd1d_advection_ftcs_test</b>,
      a C++ program which
      calls fd1d_advection_ftcs() to
      apply the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the FTCS method, forward time difference,
      centered space difference, writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.

      Graphical output for this program was created using GNUPLOT.  Data at
      selected time steps was written to a "data" file, and the appropriate
      GNUPLOT commands were written to a "command" file.  The plot can be 
      created by the command
      <pre>
        gnuplot &lt; advection_commands.txt
      </pre>
      <ul>
