GEN_HERMITE_RULE
  C++ version

  Compiled on Mar 10 2020 at 09:00:42.

  Compute a generalized Gauss-Hermite rule for approximating

    Integral ( -oo < x < +oo ) |x-a|^ALPHA exp ( - b * ( x - a )^2 ) f(x) dx

  of order ORDER and parameter ALPHA.

  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points.

  ALPHA is the exponent of |x|.

  A is the center point:

  B is a scale factor;

  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:

    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 4
  ALPHA = 1
  A = 0
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "gen_herm_o4_a1.0".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "gen_herm_o4_a1.0".

  Weight file will be   "gen_herm_o4_a1.0_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "gen_herm_o4_a1.0_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "gen_herm_o4_a1.0_r.txt".

GEN_HERMITE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
