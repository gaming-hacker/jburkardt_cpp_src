      C8_COMPLEX_LIB <br> A C++ Class for Complex Arithmetic
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C8_COMPLEX_LIB</b>,
      a C++ library which 
      defines complex numbers and
      the operations necessary to do arithmetic on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Since the ANSI C++ standard library now includes a complex class,
      the information described here is probably not of practical use.
      On the other hand, it may be helpful as a practical demonstration
      of how to define a useful arithmetic class.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>C8_COMPLEX</b> class defines a <i>c8_complex</i> number as a pair
      of doubles.  A variable <b>c</b> in this class 
      may be declared by
      <pre><code>
        c8_complex c;
      </code></pre>
      The declaration can include an initialization:
      <pre><code>
        c8_complex c = c8_complex ( 1.0, 2.0 );
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A variable <b>c</b> declared as <i>c8_complex</i> may be assigned a value
      using the <i>c8_complex()</i> function:
      <pre><code>
        c = c8_complex ( a, b )
      </code></pre>
      where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are double values; the assignment
      <pre><code>
        c = c8_complex ( a )
      </code></pre>
      sets the real part of <b>c</b> to <b>a</b>, and the imaginary part to 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      A variable <b>c</b> declared as <i>c8_complex</i> may be used in addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, or division with another c8_complex value,
      or a double value:
      <pre><code>
        c3 = c1 + c2;
        c3 = c1 - c2;
        c3 = c1 * c2;
        c3 = c1 / c2;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A variable <b>c</b> declared as <i>c8_complex</i> may be conjugated, or
      its real or imaginary part may be produced as a double value:
      <pre><code>
        c2 = ~c;
        d1 = c1.real ( );
        d2 = c1.imaginary ( );
      </code></pre>
    </p>
