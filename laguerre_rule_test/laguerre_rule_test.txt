LAGUERRE_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a Gauss-Laguerre rule for approximating
    Integral ( a <= x < +oo ) exp(-b*(x-a)) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points used.
  A is the left endpoint (typically 0).
  B is the scale factor (typically 1).
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
  * filename_w.txt - the weight file
  * filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 4
  A = 0
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "0".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "0".

  Weight file will be   "0_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "0_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "0_r.txt".

LAGUERRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
