FEM3D_PROJECT
  C++ version.

  Read files defining a sampling of a function of 3 arguments.
  Read files defining a finite element mesh.
  Project the sample data onto the mesh, and
  write a file of FEM coefficient values.

  Sample node spatial dimension is 3
  Sample node number is            729

  Sample element order is  4
  Sample element number is 3072

  Converting 1-based sample element array to 0 base.

  The sample value dimension is    4
  The sample value number is        729

  The element neighbor array has been computed.

  The FEM node dimension is        3
  The FEM node number is           125
  The FEM element order is         4
  The FEM element number is        384

  Converting 1-based FEM element array to 0 base.

  FEM value data written to "r4x4x4_t4_values.txt"
