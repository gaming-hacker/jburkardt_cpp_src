LATIN_EDGE_TEST:
  C++ version
  Test the LATIN_EDGE library.

TEST00
  GET_SEED returns a seed for the random number
  generator, based on the current time.

  GET_SEED returns SEED = 964379230

TEST01
  LATIN_EDGE chooses a Latin cell arrangement,
  which includes the edge points.

  Spatial dimension = 2
  Number of points =  11
  Initial seed for UNIFORM = 964379230

  The Latin Edge Square points:

LATIN_EDGE_TEST:
  Repeat TEST01, but with different seed from first run.
