GEN_LAGUERRE_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a generalized Gauss-Laguerre rule for approximating
    Integral ( a <= x < +oo ) |x-a|^ALPHA exp(-B*x(x-a)) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points in the rule:
  ALPHA is the exponent of |X|:
  A is the left endpoint (typically 0).
  B is the exponential scale factor, typically 1:
  FILENAME is used  to generate 3 files:
  * filename_w.txt - the weight file
  * filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 4
  ALPHA = 0.5
  A = 0
  B = 1
  FILENAME "gen_lag_o4_a0.5".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "gen_lag_o4_a0.5".

  Weight file will be   "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_r.txt".

GEN_LAGUERRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
