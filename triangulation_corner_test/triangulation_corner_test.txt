TRIANGULATION_CORNER
  C++ version:

  Read a node file of NODE_NUM point coordinates in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangle file of
  TRIANGLE_NUM triangles, listing 3 or 6 node indices.

  Any triangle which has exactly two sides on the boundary
  is a corner triangle.

  If there are any corner triangles this program tries to
  eliminate them.

  The "repaired" triangle file is written out.

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.
