CLENSHAW_CURTIS_RULE
  C++ version

  Compiled on Feb 20 2020 at 10:06:34.

  Compute a Clenshaw Curtis rule for approximating

    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) dx

  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, A, B and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points.

  A is the left endpoint.

  B is the right endpoint.

  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:

    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 5
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "cc_o5".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "cc_o5".

  Weight file will be   "cc_o5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "cc_o5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "cc_o5_r.txt".

CLENSHAW_CURTIS_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
