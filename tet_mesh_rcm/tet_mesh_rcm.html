      TET_MESH_RCM <br> Reverse Cuthill-McKee Node Reordering
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_RCM</b>,
      a C++ code which
      computes the reverse
      Cuthill-McKee (RCM) reordering for nodes in a tetrahedral mesh ("tet mesh").
    </p>

    <p>
      The user supplies a node file and a tetrahedron file, containing
      the coordinates of the nodes, and the indices of the nodes that
      make up each tetrahedron.  Either 4-node or 10-node tetrahedrons may
      be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program reads the data, computes the adjacency information,
      carries out the RCM algorithm to get the permutation, applies
      the permutation to the nodes and tetrahedrons, and writes out
      new node and tetrahedron files that correspond to the RCM permutation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the node file would normally contain exactly 3 values
      on each line, namely the X, Y and Z coordinates of the nodes.
      However, this is not necessary.  Extra information can be
      included on each line, for instance, a "W" coordinate.  Each
      line should include the same number of items, but all will be
      permuted correctly together.  The program does not actually
      need to know the coordinates of the nodes, so in fact, ANY data
      (as long as it is real numeric data) associated with the nodes
      can be listed in the node file, and will be correctly permuted.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>tet_mesh_rcm</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common file prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates (input);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the element definitions (input).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_rcm_nodes.txt</b>,    the reordered node coordinates (output);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_rcm_elements.txt</b>,    the reordered element definitions (output).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The element definition file will list node indices.  In C++, it may be
      more natural to use 0-based indices.  This program will accept an element
      definition file that is 0-based or 1-based, and will convert a 1-based
      input file so that it becomes 0-based internal to the program.  The detection
      of 1-based data is determined by the absence of the use of a 0 index, and
      the use of an index equal to the number of nodes.  This is an implicit
      and fallible, but reasonable, way to handle this problem.
