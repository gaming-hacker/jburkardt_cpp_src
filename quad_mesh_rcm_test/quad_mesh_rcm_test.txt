QUAD_MESH_RCM
  C++ version:
  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated quad mesh dataset of ELEMENT_NUM
  4 node quaderilaterals.

  Apply the RCM reordering (Reverse Cuthill-McKee).

  Reorder the data and write it out to files.

  Read the header of "hole_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM =  28

  Read the data in "hole_nodes.txt".

  Coordinates of first 5 nodes:

  Element order  = 4
  Number of elements = 17

  Read the data in "hole_elements.txt".

  First 5 elements:

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  ADJ bandwidth = 15
ROOT = 11

  Permuted ADJ bandwidth = 17

  Created the node file "hole_rcm_nodes.txt".

  Created the element file "hole_rcm_elements.txt".

QUAD_MESH_RCM:
  Normal end of execution.
