MD_OPENMP
  C++/OpenMP version

  A molecular dynamics program.

  NP, the number of particles in the simulation is 1000
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is 400
  DT, the size of each time step, is 0.0001

  Number of processors available = 8
  Number of threads =              1

  Initializing positions, velocities, and accelerations.

  Computing initial forces and energies.

  At each step, we report the potential and kinetic energies.
  The sum of these energies should be a constant.
  As an accuracy check, we also print the relative error
  in the total energy.
