TRIANGULATION_SVG
  C++ version:
  Make an SVG plot of triangulated data.

  This program expects two files:
  * prefix_nodes.txt,    node coordinates,
  * prefix_elements.txt, indices of nodes forming elements,
  and creates:
  * prefix.svg, an SVG image of the triangulation.

  Read the header of "lake_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  = 621

  Read the data in "lake_nodes.txt".

  5 by 5 portion of data read from file:

  Row:       1             2       
  Col

    1         316.43       404.476
    2        291.049       400.709
    3        265.165       409.779
    4        241.468       402.403
    5        216.551       396.521

 Read the header of "lake_elements.txt".

  Element order ELEMENT_ORDER = 3
  Number of elements ELEMENT_NUM  = 973

  Read the data in "lake_elements.txt".

  5 by 5 portion of data read from file:

  Row:      1       2       3  
  Col

    1     619     618      39  
    2     620     619      39  
    3     125     126       7  
    4     125     132     126  
    5     143     135     150  

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  Graphics data written to file "lake.svg"

TRIANGULATION_SVG:
  Normal end of execution.
