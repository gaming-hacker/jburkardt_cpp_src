FEM2D_HEAT_RECTANGLE
  C++ version

  Compiled on Mar  5 2020 at 07:59:32.

  Solution of the time-dependent heat equation
  on a unit box in 2 dimensions.

  Ut - Uxx - Uyy = F(x,y,t) in the box
        U(x,y,t) = G(x,y,t) for (x,y) on the boundary.
        U(x,y,t) = H(x,y,t) for t = T_INIT.

  The finite element method is used, with piecewise
  quadratic basis functions on 6 node triangular
  elements.

  The corner nodes of the triangles are generated by an
  underlying grid whose dimensions are

  NX =                 5
  NY =                 5

  Number of nodes    = 81
  Number of elements = 32

  The matrix half bandwidth is 18
  The matrix row size is       55
