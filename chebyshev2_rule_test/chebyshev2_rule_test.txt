CHEBYSHEV2_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a Gauss-Chebyshev type 2 rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) * sqrt ( ( x - A ) * ( B - x ) ) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points:
  A is the left endpoint:
  B is the right endpoint:
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 5
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME "cheby2_o5".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "cheby2_o5".

  Weight file will be   "cheby2_o5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "cheby2_o5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "cheby2_o5_r.txt".

CHEBYSHEV2_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
