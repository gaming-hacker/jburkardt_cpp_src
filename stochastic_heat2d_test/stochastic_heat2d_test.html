      <b>stochastic_heat2d_test</b>,
      a C++ program which 
      calls stochastic_heat2d() to solve the steady state heat equation in a 2D
      rectangular region with a stochastic heat diffusivity, 
      using the finite difference method (FDM), and stochastic model
      from Babuska, Nobile and Tempone, using GNUPLOT to illustrate
      the results.
