    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_VOLUMES</b>,
      a C++ code which
      computes the volume of every tetrahedron in a tet mesh.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>tet_mesh_volume</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common file prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_volumes.txt</b>, will contain the element volumes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The element definition file will list node indices.  In C++, it may be
      more natural to use 0-based indices.  This program will accept an element
      definition file that is 0-based or 1-based, and will convert a 1-based
      input file so that it becomes 0-based internal to the program.  The detection
      of 1-based data is determined by the absence of the use of a 0 index, and
      the use of an index equal to the number of nodes.  This is an implicit
      and fallible, but reasonable, way to handle this problem.
