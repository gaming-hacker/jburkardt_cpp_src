TET_MESH_L2Q
  C++ version
  Read a "linear" tet mesh and
  write out a "quadratic" one.

  Read a node file of NODE_NUM1 nodes in 3 dimensions.
  Read an associated tet mesh of TETRA_NUM
  tetrahedrons, using 4 nodes per tetrahedron.

  Create new nodes which are midpoints of sides,
  generate new node and tet mesh data for
  quadratic 10-node tetrahedrons, and write them out.
