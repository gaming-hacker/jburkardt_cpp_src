    <p>
      <b>c++_calls_c_test</b>
      C++ programs which
      illustrates how a C++ program can call a C function.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this example, the KRONROD package is used.  Note that the KRONROD
      library is available in C++ and in C, so this example is not
      created out of necessity (the C++ main program could have simply called
      the C++ version of KRONROD).  Instead, it is intended as an example of
      how to do this when you have to (you don't have a C++ version of the
      routines you want to use.)
    </p>

    <p>
      When calling a C function from a C++ function, there are
      some simple things that may be enough to guarantee success.
      <ul>
        <li>
          the C++ code should declare interfaces to the C functions
          using the "extern C" qualifier, as in
          <pre>
extern "C" 
{
  void kronrod ( int n, double eps, double x[], double w1[], double w2[] );
  void timestamp ( );
}
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
