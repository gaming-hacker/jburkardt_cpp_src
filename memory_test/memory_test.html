      MEMORY_TEST <br> How Big Can Arrays Be?
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MEMORY_TEST</b>,
      a C++ program which
      declares and uses a sequence of larger and larger arrays,
      to see what the memory limits are on a given computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program tries an increasing series of values of <b>N</b>, using
      powers of 2, between limits that you set.  At some point, the program
      may ask for more memory than can be provided, and crash.  This is one
      way to find out what the memory ceiling is!  The relevant power of 2
      is likely to be in the 20's:

        <tr>
          <th>Log(N)</th><th>N</th>
        </tr>

    <p>
      Remember that your memory is probably described in terms of bytes,
      but that integers and reals require 4 bytes, and double precision reals
      require 8 bytes.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>memory_test</b> <i>log_n_min</i> <i>log_n_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      runs the program for sizes <b>N</b> = 2<sup>log_n_min</sup> to
      2<sup>log_n_max</sup>.
