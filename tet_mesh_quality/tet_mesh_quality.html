      Interactive Program for <br>
      Tet Mesh Quality
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_QUALITY</b>,
      a C++ code which
      computes and prints a variety
      of quality measures for a given tet mesh of a set of
      points in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tet mesh is defined by a <i>node file</i> containing
      the coordinates of nodes, and a <i>tetra file</i> containing
      quadruples of node indices.  For more information on this format,
      see
      <a href = "../../data/tet_mesh_order4/tet_mesh_order4.html">
      the order4 tet mesh format</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality measures computed include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Measure 1</b>, the minimum, over all tetrahedrons, of 3 times
          the radius of the insphere divided by the radius of the circumsphere.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Measure 2</b>, the minimum, over all tetrahedrons, of 2 times
          sqrt ( 6 ) times the radius of the insphere divided by the
          length of the longest side of the tetrahedron.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Measure 3</b>, the minimum, over all tetrahedrons, of
          12 * ( 3 * volume )**(2/3) / (sum of squares of edge lengths);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Measure 4</b>, the minimum solid angle in any tetrahedron;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Measure 5</b>, a uniformity measure, the ratio of the
          maximum to minimum tetrahedron volume;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each quality measure is defined as the minimum of its value
      over each tetrahedron.  The maximum and best possible value is 1, and
      the minimum and worst value is 0.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>tet_mesh_quality</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common file prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt or<br> the node indices forming each element.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The element definition file will list node indices.  In C++, it may be
      more natural to use 0-based indices.  This program will accept an element
      definition file that is 0-based or 1-based, and will convert a 1-based
      input file so that it becomes 0-based internal to the program.  The detection
      of 1-based data is determined by the absence of the use of a 0 index, and
      the use of an index equal to the number of nodes.  This is an implicit
      and fallible, but reasonable, way to handle this problem.
