HEAT_MPI:
  C++/MPI version
  Solve the 1D time-dependent heat equation.

  Compute an approximate solution to the time dependent
  one dimensional heat equation:

    dH/dt - K * d2H/dx2 = f(x,t)

  for 0 = x_min < x < x_max = 1

  and 0 = time_min < t <= t_max = 10

  Boundary conditions are specified at x_min and x_max.
  Initial conditions are specified at time_min.

  The finite difference method is used to discretize the
  differential equation.

  This uses 88 equally spaced points in X
  and 400 equally spaced points in time.

  Parallel execution is done using 8 processors.
  Domain decomposition is used.
  Each processor works on 11 nodes, 
  and shares some information with its immediate neighbors.

UPDATE
  CFL stability criterion value = 0.37845

  Wall clock elapsed seconds = 0.00168035

HEAT_MPI:
  Normal end of execution.
