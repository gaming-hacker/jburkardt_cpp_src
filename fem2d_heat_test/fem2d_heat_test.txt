FEM2D_HEAT
  C++ version:

  Compiled on Mar  5 2020 at 07:37:48.

  Solution of the time dependent heat equation
  on an arbitrary triangulated region D in 2 dimensions.

  Ut - Uxx - Uyy + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t) in D
                              U = G(x,y,t) on the boundary.
                              U = H(x,y,t) at initial time.

  The finite element method is used with
  6 node quadratic triangular elements ("T6").

  The time derivative is approximated using the
  backward Euler method.
