      <b>cg_test</b>,
      a C++ program which
      calls cg() to
      implement a simple version of the conjugate gradient (CG) method
      for solving a system of linear equations of the form A*x=b, 
      suitable for situations in which the matrix A is 
      symmetric positive definite (SPD)
      (only real, positive eigenvalues).
