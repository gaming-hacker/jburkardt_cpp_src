      MULTITASK_OPENMP <br> Carrying Out Multiple "Tasks" in OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MULTITASK_OPENMP</b>,
      a C++ code which
      demonstrates how to "multitask", that is, to execute several unrelated
      and distinct tasks simultaneously, using OpenMP for parallel execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program demonstrates how OpenMP can be used for multitasking, that 
      is, a simple kind of parallel processing in which a certain number of 
      perhaps quite unrelated tasks must be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenMP SECTIONS directive identifies the portion of the program where
      the code for these tasks is given.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenMP SECTION directive is used repeatedly to divide this area of
      the program into independent tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code will get the benefit of parallel processing up to the point where
      there are as many threads as there are tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code will get a substantial speedup if the tasks take roughly the
      same amount of time.  However, if one task takes substantially more time
      than the others, this results in a limit to the parallel speedup that is
      possible.
