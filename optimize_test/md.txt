MD
  C++ version
  A molecular dynamics program.

  Enter ND, the spatial dimension (2 or 3).

  Enter NP, the number of points (500, for instance).

  Enter ND, the number of time steps (500 or 1000, for instance).

  ND, the spatial dimension, is 3
  NP, the number of particles in the simulation is 1000
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is 400
  DT, the size of each time step, is 0.0001

  Initializing positions, velocities, and accelerations.

  Computing initial forces and energies.
