    <p>
      <b>htmlindex</b>,
      a C++ code which 
      builds a "skeleton" HTML page for
      a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 source code file, documenting every
      routine in the file...<b>if</b> each routine has been appropriately
      marked.  The information after the marker is usually a one line
      explanations of what the routine does.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
        Purpose:

          ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre> 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a C++ file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      // Purpose:
      //
      //    ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre> 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a FORTRAN77 file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      cc ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a FORTRAN90 file, the special marker line has the form
      <pre>
      !! ROUTINE has this purpose.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      After a little editing, the page is ready for posting.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>htmlindex</b> <i>myprog.c</i> &gt; <i>myprog.html</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.c</i> is a C file to be processed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Similar commands work for C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 files.
