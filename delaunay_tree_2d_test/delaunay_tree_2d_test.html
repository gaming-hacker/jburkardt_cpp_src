      <b>delaunay_tree_2d_test</b>,
      a C++ program which
      calls delaunay_tree_2d() to
      read a file of point coordinates in 2D and produce a PostScript file
      containing an image of the Delaunay triangulation of the points.

      <b>DIAMOND_02_00009</b> is a set of 9 points.  Unfortunately,
      the data is scaled to lie in the unit box, so <b>TABLE_SCALE</b>
      was called to rescale both X and Y to lie between 0 and 612:

          <a href = "diamond_02_00009.txt">devillers_02_00009.txt</a>,
