CHARACTER_ARG:
  Demonstrate how a C function can return character data
  through the argument list.

  Our main program declares a string:
    string name;
  then calls function fred() with the ADDRESS of the string:
    fred ( &name );
  Function fred receives its argument as
    void fred ( string *name )
  It sets a value to the string:
    *name = "ob_data.txt" );
  The main program now has a string stored in name.

  The value of name is now = "ob_data.txt".

CHARACTER_ARG:
  Normal end of execution.
