COMPLEX_VALUES
  C++ version
  Demonstrate the use of the ANSI COMPLEX class.

TEST01
  Look at assignment operators.
  Note that it might seem natural to try the assignment
  statement in the form:

    variable = ( float, float )

  but as the examples will show, this is NOT the correct way!


  complex <float> a = ( 1.0, 2.0 ) in initialization.
  a = (2,0)

  complex <float> b ( 3.0, 4.0 ) in initialization.
  b = (3,4)

  a = ( 5.0, 6.0 ) in executable statement.
  a = (6,0)

  a = ( complex <float> ) ( 7.0, 8.0 ) in executable statement.
  a = (8,0)

  a = complex <float> ( 9.0, 10.0 ) in executable statement.
  a = (9,10)

  a = complex <float> ( 11.0 ) in executable statement.
  a = (11,0)

  Use two float variables for assignment:
  c = 12
  d = 13
  a = complex <float> ( c, d ) in executable statement.
  a = (12,13)

  Use one float variable for assignment:
  c = 12
  a = complex <float> ( c ) in executable statement.
  a = (12,0)

CONCLUSION:
  To initialize a complex number in a declaration:

    complex <float> a ( 1.0, 2.0 )

  To assign a complex number a complex value:

    a = complex <float> ( 3.0, 4.0 )
    a = complex <float> ( b, c )

  To assign a complex number a real value:

    a = complex <float> ( 5.0 )
    a = complex <float> ( d )

TEST02
  Look at complex array initialization.

    complex <float> a[3] = {
      ( 1.0, 2.0 ),
      ( 3.0, 4.0 ),
      ( 5.0, 6.0 ) }

  A:

         (2,0)
         (4,0)
         (6,0)

    complex <float> b[3] = {
      complex <float> ( 1.0, 2.0 ),
      complex <float> ( 3.0, 4.0 ),
      complex <float> ( 5.0, 6.0 ) }

  B:

         (1,2)
         (3,4)
         (5,6)

CONCLUSION:
  To initialize a complex vector in a declaration:

    complex <float> b[3] = {
      complex <float> ( 1.0, 2.0 ),
      complex <float> ( 3.0, 4.0 ),
      complex <float> ( 5.0, 6.0 ) }


TEST03
  Look at new function calls.


  A =                 (3,4)
  real ( A ) =            3
  imag ( A ) =            4
  arg ( A ) =      0.927295
  norm ( A ) =           25
  abs ( A ) =             5
  conj ( A ) =       (3,-4)
  polar ( abs ( a ), arg ( a ) ) =        (3,4)

COMPLEX_VALUES
  Normal end of execution.
