      FEM2D_HEAT <br>
      Finite Element Solution of the Heat Equation <br>
      on a Triangulated Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT</b>,
      a C++ program which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of the time-dependent heat equation over an arbitrary
      triangulated region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is initially unknown by the program.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the user does not type in this information by hand, but has
      a program fill in the nodes, and perhaps another program that
      constructs the triangulation.  However, in the simplest case,
      the user might construct a very crude triangulation by hand, and
      have TRIANGULATION_REFINE refine it to something more reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
       10-11-12
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        6  7 8  9
        |   \|   \
        1-2--3--4-5
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0  0.0
         1.0  0.0
         2.0  0.0
         3.0  0.0
         4.0  0.0
         0.0  1.0
         1.0  1.0
         2.0  1.0
         3.0  1.0
         0.0  2.0
         1.0  2.0
         2.0  2.0
      </pre>
      and the triangle file would be
      <pre>
         1  3 10  2  7  6
         3  5 12  4  9  8
        12 10  3 11  7  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to handle the time dependent heat
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(T,X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        Ut - ( Uxx + Uyy ) + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t)  in the region
                                        U = G(x,y,t)  on the boundary
                                        U = H(x,y,t)  at initial time TINIT.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the right hand side function F(x,y,t), the linear
      coefficient K(x,y,t), the boundary condition function G(x,y,t),
      and the initial condition H(x,y,t),
      the user has to supply a file, perhaps called <i>myprog.C</i>, 
      containing several functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>double rhs ( int node_num, double node_xy[], double time )</b>
          evaluates the right hand side forcing term F(x,y,t).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>double k_coef ( int node_num, double node_xy[], double time )</b>
          evaluates K(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>double *dirichlet_condition ( int node_num, double node_xy[], double time )</b>
          evaluates G(x,y,t) for all nodes on the boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>double *initial_condition ( int node_num, double node_xy[], double time )</b>
          evaluates H(x,y,t) for all nodes at the initial time.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        g++ fem2d_heat.cpp <i>myprog.cpp</i> <br>
        mv a.out fem2d_heat<br>
        fem2d_heat <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where prefix is the common file prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          "prefix"_nodes.txt, contains the node coordinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          "prefix"_elements.txt, contains the indices of nodes that form elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
