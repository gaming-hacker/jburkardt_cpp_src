    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CNF_IO</b>,
      a C++ library which 
      can read or write a file, in the DIMACS CNF format, containing
      information about a boolean formula written in conjunctive normal form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boolean expressions, written in conjunctive normal form, may be used 
      as test cases for the satisfiability problem.  That problem seeks to
      determine all possible combinations of variable values that result in
      the formula being evaluated as TRUE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The routines in CNF_IO are intended to make it possible to
      transfer information between a CNF file and a computer program.
