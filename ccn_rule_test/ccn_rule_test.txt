  Compiled on Feb 14 2020 at 10:02:45.

  Compute one of a family of nested Clenshaw Curtis rules
  for approximating
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) dx
  of order N.

  The user specifies N, A, B and FILENAME.

  N is the number of points.
  A is the left endpoint.
  B is the right endpoint.
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  N = 9
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "ccn_o9".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "ccn_o9".

  Weight file will be   "ccn_o9_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "ccn_o9_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "ccn_o9_r.txt".

CCN_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
