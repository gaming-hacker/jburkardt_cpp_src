//
//  Purpose:
//
//    MAIN is the main program for HEATED_PLATE_OPENMP.
//
//  Discussion:
//
//    This code solves the steady state heat equation on a rectangular region.
//
//    The sequential version of this program needs approximately
//    18/epsilon iterations to complete. 
//
//
//    The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
//    by this diagram;
//
//                   W = 0
//             +------------------+
//             |                  |
//    W = 100  |                  | W = 100
//             |                  |
//             +------------------+
//                   W = 100
//
//    The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
//    array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
//    array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
//    indices of the four corners:
//
//                  I = 0
//          [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
//             |                  |
//      J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
//             |                  |
//        [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
//                  I = M-1
//
//    The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
//    following condition at an interior grid point:
//
//      W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
//
//    where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
//    of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
//   
//    Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
//    "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
//    average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
//    as an ASSIGNMENT statement:
//
//      W[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
//
//    If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between successive 
//    estimates of the solution will go to zero.
//
//    This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
//    the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
//    be used for graphic processing.
