TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS
  C++ version
  Read a tet mesh dataset of TETRA_NUM
  tetrahedrons, using 4 or 10 nodes.

  Compute the tet mesh neighbors, and write this
  information to a file

  Compiled on Apr 29 2020 at 13:06:38.

  Read the header of "cube_elements.txt".
  Tetrahedron order = 4
  Number of tetras  = 6

  Read the data in "cube_elements.txt".

  First 5 tetrahedrons:

  Row:      1       2       3       4  
  Col

    1       4       3       5       1  
    2       4       2       5       1  
    3       4       7       3       5  
    4       4       7       8       5  
    5       4       6       2       5  

TET_MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  First 5 neighbor sets:

  Row:      1       2       3       4  
  Col

    1      -1       2      -1       3  
    2      -1       1      -1       5  
    3      -1       1       4      -1  
    4      -1       6       3      -1  
    5      -1       2       6      -1  

  Created the file "cube_element_neighbors.txt".

TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS:
  Normal end of execution.
