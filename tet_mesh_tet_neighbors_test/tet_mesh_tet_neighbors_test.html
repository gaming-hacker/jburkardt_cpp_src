      <b>tet_mesh_tet_neighbors_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls tet_mesh_tet_neighbors(), which
      reads information defining
      a tet mesh of points in 3D, and determines, for each face of
      each tetrahedron, the index of the neighboring tetrahedron that
      shares that face.
