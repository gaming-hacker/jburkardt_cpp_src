    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>LINPACK_C</b>,
      a C++ library which
      can solve systems of linear equations for a variety
      of matrix types and storage modes, using single precision complex arithmetic,
      by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler, Pete Stewart.
    </p>

    <p>
      LINPACK has officially been superseded by the LAPACK library.  The LAPACK
      library uses more modern algorithms and code structure.  However,
      the LAPACK library can be extraordinarily complex; what is done
      in a single <b>LINPACK</b> routine may correspond to 10 or 20 utility
      routines in LAPACK.  This is fine if you treat LAPACK as a black
      box.  But if you wish to learn how the algorithm works, or
      to adapt it, or to convert the code to another language, this
      is a real drawback.  This is one reason I still keep a copy
      of <b>LINPACK</b> around.

      Versions of <b>LINPACK</b> in various arithmetic precisions are available
      through <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
