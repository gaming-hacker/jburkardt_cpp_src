LEGENDRE_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a Gauss-Legendre rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, A, B and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points.
  A is the left endpoint.
  B is the right endpoint.
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 4
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "leg_o4".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "leg_o4".

  Weight file will be   "leg_o4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "leg_o4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "leg_o4_r.txt".

LEGENDRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
