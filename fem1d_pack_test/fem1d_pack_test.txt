FEM1D_PACK_TEST
  C++ version
  Test the FEM1D_PACK library.

TEST01:
  LOCAL_BASIS_1D evaluates the local basis functions
  for a 1D element.

  Test that the basis functions, evaluated at the nodes,
  form the identity matrix.

  Number of nodes = 4

  Node coordinates:

         0        1
         1        2
         2        4
         3      4.5

  A(I,J) = PHI(I) at node (J):

  Col:          0             1             2             3       
  Row

    0:            1            -0             0            -0  
    1:            0             1            -0             0  
    2:           -0             0             1            -0  
    3:            0            -0             0             1  

  The PHI functions should sum to 1 at random X values:

       X        Sum ( PHI(:)(X) )

         1.76446               1
         4.34711               1
         3.90328               1
         2.96593               1
         2.45357               1
