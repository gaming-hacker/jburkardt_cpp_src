      FEM2D_PROJECT_FUNCTION <br> Piecewise Linear Finite Element Approximation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_PROJECT_FUNCTION</b>,
      a C++ program which
      projects a function W(X,Y), given as a formula,
      into a given finite element method (FEM) space
      of piecewise linear triangular elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is that the function W(x,y) is approximated by a finite element
      function U(x,y) formed using piecewise linear triangular elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is a rectangle, which is divided up into a mesh
      of triangles using a grid of NX by NY points.
      For node K at grid point (I,J)
      in the interior,
      the associated basis function Vk(x,y) is used to pose the equation:
      <pre>
        Integral U(x,y) Vk(x,y) dx = Integral W(x,y) Vk(x,y) dx
      </pre>
      while, for node K at grid point (I,J) on the boundary, the associated degree of freedom
      is determined by the boundary condition
      <pre>
        U(x,y) = W(x,y),
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The conditions define a linear system for the coefficients Uk in the finite
      element expansion of U(x,y):
      <pre>
        U(x,y) = sum ( 1 <= K <= M*N ) Uk * Vk(x,y)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program computes these coefficients, compares U and W pointwise at
      the nodes, and computes the L2 norms of U, W and U-W.
