      DREAM <br> Markov Chain Monte Carlo acceleration by Differential Evolution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DREAM</b>,
      a C++ program which
      implements the DREAM algorithm for accelerating 
      Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence using differential evolution,
      by Guannan Zhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires user input in the form of five C++
      functions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>problem_size()</i>, defines the sizes of problem parameters;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>problem_value()</i>, defines the value of problem parameters;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prior_density()</i>, evaluates the prior distribution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prior_sample()</i>, samples the prior distribution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_likelihood()</i>, evaluates the log likelihood function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Examples of such user input are listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires access to a compiled version of the
      pdflib library, which can evaluate a variety of Probability
      Density Functions (PDF's) and produce samples from them.
      The user may wish to invoke this library when constructing
      some of the user functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires access to a compiled version of the
      rnglib library, in order to generate random numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      An older implementation of the DREAM algorithm is available
      as DREAM1; it requires a user main program and two input files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DREAM program was originally developed by Guannan Zhang, of
      Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL); it has been incorporated into 
      the DAKOTA package of Sandia National Laboratory, and forms 
      part of the ORNL package known as TASMANIAN.
