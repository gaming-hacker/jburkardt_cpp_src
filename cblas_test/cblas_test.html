    <p>
      <b>cblas_test</b>,
      C++ programs which
      illustrates the use of the CBLAS,
      a C translation of the FORTRAN77 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS)
      which are used by the C translation of the FORTRAN77 LAPACK linear algebra
      library.
    </p>

    <p>
      The translation of the BLAS source code from FORTRAN77 to C was done 
      using the automatic F2C translator.  As a consequence, the resulting C 
      source code is unreadable by the user, but should execute precisely
      as the FORTRAN77 code did.
    </p>

    <p>
      A user calling program must have the necessary "include" statements.
      Usually, this means adding the statements:
      <pre>
        # include "blaswrap.h"
        # include "f2c.h"
        # include "clapack.h"
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, all variables that will be passed to a CBLAS function
      must be declared using types that can be handled by the FORTRAN
      package.  In general, this only affects integer variables; as a rule
      this means that if N is an integer scalar, vector or array that will
      be passed to CBLAS, its type must be either "integer" (a type defined
      by f2c.h), or else as "long int" (a standard C type).  Declaring such
      a variable as "int" will not work!
    </p>

    <p>
      Each user accessible routine in the FORTRAN version of the BLAS 
      has a corresponding CBLAS version.  However, to access the CLAPACK 
      version, the user must specify the name of the routine in lower case
      letters only, and must append an underscore to the name.  Thus,
      to access a BLAS function such as DNRM2(), the user's C code must
      look something like this:
      <pre>
        norm = dnrm2_ ( <i>list of arguments</i> );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Because all FORTRAN subroutine arguments can be modified during the
      execution of the subroutine, the CBLAS interface requires that
      every argument in the argument list must be modifiable.  In cases
      where a vector or array is being passed, this happens automatically.
      However, when passing a scalar variable, such as "N", the size of 
      the linear system, or "LDA", the leading dimension of array A,
      or "INFO", an error return flag, it is necessary to prefix the name
      with an ampersand.  Thus, a call to DGESV() might look like:
      <pre>
        dgesv_ ( &n, &nrhs, a, &lda, ipiv, b, &ldb, &info );
      </pre>
      because <b>n</b>, <b>nrhs</b>, <b>lda</b>, <b>ldb</b> and <b>info</b> 
      are scalar variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vector and matrix arguments to the CBLAS routine don't require 
      the ampersand.  Moreover, vectors (singly indexed lists of numbers)
      essentially work the same in C and FORTRAN, so it's not difficult
      to correctly set up vector arguments for CBLAS.  However, matrices
      (doubly indexed sets of data) are handled differently, and the user's
      C code must either set up the data in a FORTRAN way immediately, or
      else set it up in a way natural to C and then convert the data to make
      a FORTRAN copy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume that we have an M by N set of data, and to be concrete,
      let's consider an example where M = 3 and N = 2.  In C, it would be
      natural to declare this data as follows:
      <pre>
        double a[3][2] = {
          { 11, 12 },
          { 21, 22 },
          { 31, 32 } };
      </pre>
      In this case, the (I,J) entry (using 0-based indexing) 
      can be retrieved as <b>a[i][j]</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, FORTRAN essentially stores a matrix as a vector, in which
      the data is stored on column at a time.  Thus, if we wished to pass
      the example data to CBLAS as an array, we might instead use the following
      declaration:
      <pre>
        double b[3*2] = {
          11, 21, 31,
          12, 22, 32 };
      </pre>
      In this case, the (I,J) entry (using 0-based indexing) can be retrieved 
      as <b>b[i+j*3]</b> where the number 3 is the "leading dimension" of the 
      array, that is, the length of one column.
    </p>

    <p>
      But suppose we need to build the array using the double indexed version,
      although we know we have to pass a single indexed copy to CBLAS?
      Then we can start with the following declarations:
       <pre>
        double a[3][2];
        double b[3*2];
      </pre>
      and calculate the entries of <b>a</b> using double indexing, and then
      copy the information into <b>b</b> using code like the following:
      <pre>
        for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ )
        {
          for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
          {
            b[i+j*3] = a[i][j];
          }
        }
      </pre>
      after which, the vector <b>b</b> will contain a copy of the data that
      is in <b>a</b>, suitable for use by CBLAS.
