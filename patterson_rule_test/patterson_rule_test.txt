  C++ version

  Compiled on Mar 30 2020 at 09:54:37.

  Compute a Gauss-Patterson rule for approximating
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255 or 511.
  A is the left endpoint.
  B is the right endpoint.
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = 15
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME = "gp_o15".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "gp_o15".

  Weight file will be   "gp_o15_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "gp_o15_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "gp_o15_r.txt".

PATTERSON_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
