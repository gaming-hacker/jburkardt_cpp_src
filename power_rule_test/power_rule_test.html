      <b>power_rule_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls power_rule(), which
      creates a power rule, that is, a multidimensional quadrature rule
      formed as a repeated product of a single one-dimensional quadrature rule.

      We give the command
      <blockquote>
        <b>power_rule</b>  cc3  2

      to create a Clenshaw Curtis product rule of order 3x3 for a 2D region.
