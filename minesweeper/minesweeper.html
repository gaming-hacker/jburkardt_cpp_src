    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>MINESWEEPER</b>,
      a C++ program which
      emulates the popular Minesweeper game, using ASCII graphics,
      by Detelina Stoyanova.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program sets up an 8 by 8 board, with 10 mines.  The minefield
      is displayed, using '-' to indicate unknown squares, a blank for clear
      squares, and a number for a clear square with that many mined neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user selects a square by typing in the row and column number.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three optional inputs:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b> means you want to mark a possible mine.  The program asks you
          to specify a row and column, and places a '?' there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>U</b> means you want to unmark a possible mine.  The program
          places a '-' there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q</b> means you want to quit the game immediately;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
