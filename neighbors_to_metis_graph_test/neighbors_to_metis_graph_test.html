      <b>neighbors_to_metis_graph_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls neighbors_to_metis_graph(), which
      reads a file describing
      the graph-theoretic adjacency structure of the
      elements in a mesh of triangles or tetrahedrons and writes out a similar file
      that is suitable for input to the mesh partitioning
      program metis().
