MONTE_CARLO_RULE
  C++ version
  Compiled on Mar 27 2020 at 17:00:18.

  Compute the abscissas and weights of a quadrature rule
  that is simply a Monte Carlo sampling.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * M, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED, a positive integer.

  Output from the program includes
  a set of 3 files that define the quadrature rule.

    (1) "mc_m?_n?_s?_r.txt", the ranges;
    (2) "mc_m?_n?_s?_w.txt", the weights;
    (3) "mc_m?_n?_s?_x.txt", the abscissas.

  M = 4
  N = 100
  S = 123456789

  Region file will be   "mc_d4_n100_s123456789_r.txt".
  Weight file will be   "mc_d4_n100_s123456789_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "mc_d4_n100_s123456789_x.txt".

MONTE_CARLO_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
