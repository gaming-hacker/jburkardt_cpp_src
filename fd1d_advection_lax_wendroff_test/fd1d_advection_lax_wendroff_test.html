      <b>fd1d_advection_lax_wendroff_test</b>,
      a C++ program which
      calls fd1d_advection_lax_wendroff() to
      apply the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the Lax-Wendroff method for the time derivative,
      writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.

      Graphical output for this program was created using GNUPLOT.  Data at selected
      time steps was written to a "data" file, and the appropriate GNUPLOT commands were
      written to a "command" file.  The plot can be created by the command
      <pre>
        gnuplot &lt; advection_commands.txt
      </pre>
