  Compiled on Mar 16 2020 at 10:04:34.

  Compute a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule for
    Integral ( -oo < x < +oo ) f(x) rho(x) dx
  where the weight rho(x) is:
    exp ( - b * ( x - a )^2 ) * sqrt ( b / pi ) dx
  using N points.

  The user specifies N, A, B, SCALE, and FILENAME.

  N is the number of points;
  A is the center point, usually 0.0:
  B is a scale factor, usually 0.5 or 1.0;
  SCALE is a normalization option (0/1)
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  N =  4
  A = 0
  B = 1
  SCALE = 0
  FILENAME = "herm_o4".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "herm_o4".

  Weight file will be   "herm_o4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "herm_o4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "herm_o4_r.txt".

HERMITE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
