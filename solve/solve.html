      SOLVE <br> Linear Solver for Double Dimensioned Arrays
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SOLVE</b>,
      a C++ code which
      implements a linear solver which makes it easy to create 
      doubly-dimensioned arrays and solve associated linear systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the library is to allow the user to declare a square
      matrix A of any size, access matrix entries using the usual double
      indexing formula <b>A[i][j]=value;</b>, and call a linear solver
      to solve A*x=b using a call like:
      <pre>
        x = solve ( n, A, b );
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In C and C++, it can be awkward to set up matrices in a way that makes it
      easy to access them with the usual two index form, and to pass these
      matrices back and forth to other functions.  This is because, when 
      using the simplest interface to another function, it is necessary
      that the second dimension, that is, the number of columns, be declared
      as a fixed integer, not a variable.  Such an interface is impossible
      to use with a general purpose linear solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      These problems can be overcome by using a data structure known as
      a pointer to a pointer.  However, creating and deleting such objects
      can be unfamiliar to the average user.  This library hides the details
      behind an object called an R8RMAT, that is, a double precision real (R8)
      row-major (R) matrix (MAT).  A set of functions, with the "r8rmat_"
      label, are provided to make it easy to create and delete such objects,
      and more importantly, to solve an associated linear system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SOLVE library makes it possible to set up and solve linear systems
      in a natural way, as long as the user does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          declare the matrix as a "double **" quantity;
        </li>
        <li>
          call <b>r8rmat_new()</b> or <b>r8rmat_zero()</b> to create,
          or create and zero out, the matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          call <b>r8rmat_fs_new()</b> to solve the linear system.
        </li>
        <li>
          call <b>r8rmat_delete()</b> to free the matrix memory when
          no longer needed.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>

    <p>
      The library can also be useful because:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it shows the steps involved in a simple Gauss-elimination procedure;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used to count the number of operations in Gauss-elimination;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a guide for writing a corresponding program
          in another language;
        </li>
        <li>
          its performance can be compared to corresponding versions in 
          Fortran or Matlab;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a starting point for exploring band storage,
          sparse storage, iterative solutions and other topics in linear 
          algebra.
        </li>
      </ul>
