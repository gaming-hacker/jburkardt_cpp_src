      NEIGHBORS_TO_METIS_GRAPH <br> Reformat Tet Mesh Neighbor File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NEIGHBORS_TO_METIS_GRAPH</b>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a file describing
      the graph-theoretic adjacency structure of the
      elements in a mesh of triangles or tetrahedrons and writes out a similar file
      that is suitable for input to the mesh partitioning
      program metis().
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we know we are dealing with a triangle or tet mesh, each "node" of
      the adjacency graph has 3 or 4 potential edges.  If a potential
      edge is not used (in other words, if a face is a boundary face),
      then by convention we write out a "-1" for the neighbor value.
      Otherwise, the adjacency information lists the index of the
      element that is a neighbor on that face of the
      element
    </p>

    <p>
      Converting to a METIS GRAPH format is trivial.  We include
      an initial line that lists the number of "nodes" (elements)
      and "edges" (interfaces between pairs of elements), followed by,
      for each node (element), a list of the adjacent nodes (a list
      of the adjacent elements, omitting the "-1" values).  A cross-eyed
      schoolboy sitting on a tack would be able to carry out this task!
