      STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D <br> 2D Steady Heat Equation with Stochastic Diffusivity
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STOCHASTIC_HEAT2D</b>,
      a C++ program which 
      solves the steady state heat equation in a 2D
      rectangular region with a stochastic heat diffusivity, 
      using the finite difference method (FDM), and stochastic model
      from Babuska, Nobile and Tempone, using GNUPLOT to illustrate
      the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram:
      <pre>
                   U = 0, Y = 1.0
             +-------------------+
             |          ...      |
             |         .:*:.     |
    U = 0    |          :::      | U = 0
    X = 0.0  |                   | X = 1.0
             |                   |
             +-------------------+
                   U = 0, Y = 0.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A heat source is applied, which is concentrated at the point
      X = 0.6, Y = 0.8, whose center is suggested by the "*" in the diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is covered with a grid of NX by NY nodes, and an NX by NY
      array U is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
      array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
      indices of the four corners:
      <pre>
                  I = NY
             +------------------+
             |                  |
      J = 1  |                  |  J = NX
             |                  |
             +------------------+
                  I = 1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The form of the steady heat equation is
      <pre>
        - d/dx K(x,y) du/dx - d/dy K(x,y) du/dy = F(x,y)
      </pre>
      where K(x,y) is the heat conductivity, and F(x,y) is a
      heat source term.  For this program, the heat conductivity
      function is assumed to be a function of four stochastic parameters
      OMEGA(1) through OMEGA(4); the form of the functional dependence
      is described in a paper by Babusk, Nobile and Tempone.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using a simple finite difference approximation, this single equation
      can be replaced by NX * NY linear equations in NX * NY variables; 
      each equation is associated with one of the nodes in the mesh.  Nodes
      long the boundary generate boundary condition equations, while interior
      nodes generate equations that approximate the steady heat equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing a particular set of values for OMEGA produces a single "realization"
      of the temperature field.  However, an interesting question is to observe
      the influence of the OMEGA's on the solution U.  As an example, the program
      fixes the values of OMEGA(3) and OMEGA(4), evaluates the solution U over
      a grid of values for OMEGA(1) and OMEGA(2), and plots the mean of the solution.
