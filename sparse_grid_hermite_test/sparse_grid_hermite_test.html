      <b>sparse_grid_hermite_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls sparse_grid_hermite(), which
      constructs sparse grids based on 1D Gauss-Hermite rules.

      The sample program creates three files, which
      are an example of how a sparse grid quadrature rule for spatial dimension 2
      and level 3 can be defined using a Hermite quadrature rule:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "gh_d2_level3_r.txt">gh_d2_level3_r.txt</a>,
          the "R" or "region" file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "gh_d2_level3_w.txt">gh_d2_level3_w.txt</a>,
          the "W" or "weight" file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "gh_d2_level3_x.txt">gh_d2_level3_x.txt</a>,
          the "X" or "abscissa" file.
        </li>
      </ul>
