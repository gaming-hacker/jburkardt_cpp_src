      NAS <br> A Revision of the NASA Kernel Benchmark Program
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NAS</b>,
      a C++ program which
      is a revision of David Bailey's NASA kernel benchmark program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NAS benchmark program was developed around 1984, and
      measured computational performance on a representative range
      of realistic calculations.  One motivation for this benchmark was
      to move beyond the LINPACK benchmark, which focussed on a single
      highly structured procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Benchmarking computers has become much more difficult now that
      memory, I/O, multicores and distributed memory have all become
      significant factors in computing performance.  Nonetheless, the
      NAS benchmarks provide an interesting insight into the floating
      point processing power of a system, and so, for this reason, a
      version of the program has been created that retains the functionality
      of the original, while being somewhat easier to transfer to
      other languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      One might expect comparable numerical performance of C++ and FORTRAN
      programs.  That this does not seem to happen for the C++ and FORTRAN90
      versions of NAS reflects, most likely, the fact that the C++ version
      was "translated" in a fairly straightforward manner, resulting in
      some awkward and inefficient expressions; in particular, FORTRAN
      arrays which were multiply-indexed were implemented in C++ as
      vectors, with the resulting overhead of computing indices explicitly.
      Thus, it is likely that a more careful revision of the C++ source
      code would result in substantial performance improvements.
      I, on the other hand, am simply terribly relieved that the C++ program
      gets the right answers.
