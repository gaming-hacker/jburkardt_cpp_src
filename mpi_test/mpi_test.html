      <b>mpi_test</b>
      C++ codes which
      illustrate the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
      for parallel programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      MPI allows a user to write a program in a familiar language, such as
      C, C++, FORTRAN, and carry out a computation in
      parallel on an arbitrary number of cooperating computers.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Overview of MPI
    </h3>

    <p>
      A remarkable feature of MPI is that <i>the user writes
      a single program which runs on all the computers</i>.  However,
      because each computer is assigned a unique identifying number,
      it is possible for different actions to occur on different
      machines, even though they run the same program:
      <pre><code>
        if ( I am processor A ) then
          add a bunch of numbers
        else if ( I am processor B ) then
          multipy a matrix times a vector
        end
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another feature of MPI is that the data stored on each
      computer is entirely separate from that stored on other computers.
      If one computer needs data from another, or wants to send
      a particular value to all the other computers, it must
      explicitly call the appropriate library routine requesting
      a data transfer.  Depending on the library routine called,
      it may be necessary for both sender and receiver to be
      "on the line" at the same time (which means that one will
      probably have to wait for the other to show up), or it is
      possible for the sender to send the message to a buffer, for
      later delivery, allowing the sender to proceed immediately
      to further computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simple example of what a piece of the program would
      look like, in which the number <b>X</b> is presumed to have been
      computed by processor <b>A</b> and needed by processor <b>B</b>:
      <pre><code>
        if ( I am processor A ) then
          call MPI_Send ( X )
        else if ( I am processor B ) then
          call MPI_Recv ( X )
        end
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Often, an <b>MPI</b> program is written so that one computer
      supervises the work, creating data, issuing it to the
      worker computers, and gathering and printing the results at the
      end.  Other models are also possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear that a program using MPI to execute in parallel
      will look much different from a corresponding sequential version.
      The user must divide the problem data among the different processes,
      rewrite the algorithm to divide up work among the processes,
      and add explicit calls to transfer values as needed from the
      process where a data item "lives" to a process that needs that
      value.
    </p>

    <p>
      A C++ program, subroutine or function that calls any
      MPI function, or uses an MPI-defined variable, must include
      the line
      <pre><code>
        include "mpi.h"
      </code></pre>
      so that the types of the MPI variables are defined.
    </p>

    <p>
      You probably compile and link your program with a single command,
      as in
      <pre><code>
        g++ myprog.C
      </code></pre>
      Depending on the computer that you are using, you may be able
      to compile an MPI program with a similar command, which automatically
      locates the include file and the compiled libraries that you will
      need.  This command is likely to be:
      <pre><code>
        mpiCC myprog.c
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Interactive MPI Runs
    </h3>

    <p>
      Some systems allow users to run an MPI program interactively.
      You do this with the <b>mpirun</b> command:
      <pre><code>
        mpirun -np 4 a.out
      </code></pre>
      This command requests that the executable program <i>a.out</i>
      be run, <i>right now</i>, using 4 processors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>mpirun</b> command may be a convenience for beginners,
      with very small jobs, but this is not the way to go once you
      have a large lengthy program to run!  Also, what actually happens
      can vary from machine to machine.  When you ask for 4 processors,
      for instance,
      <ul>
        <li>
          in the best case, <b>mpirun</b> automatically finds three other
          machines just like the one you are one, copies your program
          to them, and starts your program on all four.
        </li>
        <li>
          in a less good case, there are four processors on your current
          machine, so the memory is divided up among them and your program
          runs;
        </li>
        <li>
          in a worse case, there are less than four processors available,
          so, as necessary, one processor will "time share", and run two
          or more of your processes alternately.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The latest versions of MPI no longer support the special C++ MPI bindings,
      so the examples given here have reverted to using the C MPI bindings.
