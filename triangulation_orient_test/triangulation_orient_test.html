      <b>triangulation_orient_test</b>,
      a C++ code which
      calls triangulation_orient(), which
      reads a triangulation, and reorients each triangle that
      has a negative area.  If at least one such triangle is encountered,
      the program writes out a new copy of the triangle file in which
      all the triangles have been correctly oriented.

      <b>P15</b> is a triangulation created by
      DISTMESH.
      Unfortunately, 512 of the triangles have a negative orientation.
      In this example, TRIANGULATION_ORIENT was used to reorient
      those triangles.
