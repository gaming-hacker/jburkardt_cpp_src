TRIANGULATION_ORIENT
  C++ version:
  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangle file of TRIANGLE_NUM
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.
 
  Ensure that every triangle has positive orientation..

  Write the reoriented triangle file.

  Read the header of "p15_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  = 614

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.

TRIANGULATION_ORIENT - Warning!
  You have 1 triangles with
  area equal to zero.

TRIANGULATION_ORIENT - Warning!
  You have 522 triangles with negative area.

  We have reoriented these triangles to have positive
  area, and written the new triangle data to
  the triangle file "p15_orient_elements.txt".
