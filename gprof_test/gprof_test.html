    <p>
      <b>gprof_test</b>,
      C++ programs which
      demonstrate the use of the GPROF performance monitoring tool.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to use GPROF with a C++ program, the user program
      must be compiled and linked with the <b>-pg</b> switch.  For example,
      either
      <pre><b>
        g++ -pg myprog.C
      </b></pre>
      or, in a two step process,
      <pre><b>
        g++ -c -pg myprog.C
        g++ -pg myprog.o
      </b></pre>
      When the resulting executable program is run, <b>GPROF</b>
      will silently monitor the program, and produce a report
      file called <b>gmon.out</b>.  This report file is not user-readable.
      To see the information contained in the report, you have to
      run <b>gprof</b> and tell it the name of the executable program
      you just ran.  A typical procedure, then, would be to issue the
      commands
      <pre>
        <i>myprog</i>            <i>(to run your program called "myprog")</i>
        <b>gprof</b> <i>myprog</i>      <i>(to have GPROF make the report)</i>
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>GPROF</b> can only report on code which has been compiled
      with the appropriate options.  If your program calls routines
      from a precompiled library (which probably was NOT compiled
      with the -pg option!) then your report information will not
      include information about the time spent in those routines.
      <b>GPROF</b>'s report will charge all such time to the higher level
      routine that called the library routine.  If most of your
      execution time occurs in various library routines, then this
      fact may greatly reduce the value of <b>GPROF</b>'s information.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information on how to use <b>GPROF</b>, type
      <pre><b>
        man gprof
      </b></pre>
