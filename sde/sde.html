    <p>
      <b>SDE</b>,
      a C++ code which 
      illustrates the properties of stochastic differential equations and some
      algorithms for handling them,
      making graphics files for processing and display by gnuplot,
      by Desmond Higham.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library requires access to the QR_SOLVE library as well.
