TET_MESH_REFINE
  C++ version
  READ a tet mesh, REFINE it, and WRITE the new data.

  READ:
    a node dataset of NODE_NUM1 points in 3 dimensions.
    a tet mesh of TETRA_NUM1 tets of order TET_ORDER.

  REFINE:
    compute a new set of nodes and tets, which is an
    eightfold refinement of the input mesh.

  WRITE:
    a node dataset of NODE_NUM2 points in 3 dimensions.
    a tet mesh of 8*TETRA_NUM1 tets of order TET_ORDER.

  At the moment, this program only works for a linear
  mesh (TET_ORDER=4).
