      SET_THEORY <br> An Implementation of Set Theoretic Operations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SET_THEORY</b>,
      a C++ library which
      implements some of the operations of set theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      We assume that a set is represented by a strictly ascending sequence
      of positive integers.  We might think of a universal set U = 1 : N
      in cases where all our subsets will have elements between 1 and N.
    </p>

    <p>
      Set theoretic operations include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>definition</i> using a numeric property: A = <b>find</b> ( mod ( U, 3 ) = 1 );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>definition</i> using an explicit list: A = <b>[</b> 1, 3, 8<b>]</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>unique</i>: creating a set from the unique elements of a list: 
          A = <b>unique</b> ( [ 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 7, 3, 1, 1 ] );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>union</i>: C = <b>union</b> ( A, B );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>intersection</i>: C = <b>intersect</b> ( A, B );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>symmetric difference</i>: C = <b>setxor</b> ( A, B );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>complement</i> with respect to the universal set: B = <b>setdiff</b> ( U, A );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>complement</i> with respect to another set: C = <b>setdiff</b> ( B, A );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>cardinality</i>: n = <b>length</b> ( A );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>membership</i>: true/false = <b>ismember</b> ( a, A );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>subset</i>: true/false = <b>ismember</b> ( B, A );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>addition of one element</i>: A = <b>unique</b> ( [ A; a ] );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>deletion of one element</i>: A = <b>setxor</b> ( A, a );
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>indexing one element</i>: i = <b>find</b> ( A == a );
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although sets are traditionally allowed to contain arbitrary elements,
      it is computationally convenient to assume that our sets are simply
      subsets of the integers from 1 to N.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If N is no greater than 32, we can represent a set using a
      32 bit integer.  We term this the <b>B4SET</b> representation.
      It is compact, but as it stands, is limited to a universal
      set of no more than 32 elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming we can regard the integer as an unsigned
      quantity, each bit of the binary representation of the integer
      represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding
      integer in the set.  Thus, assuming N is 5, the set { 1, 2, 5}
      corresponds to the binary representation 10011 and hence to the
      integer 19.  In order to read or write the individual bits of
      an integer, the functions BTEST, IBCLR and IBSET are useful in
      this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more flexible, but less efficient, representation of sets
      uses a logical vector, and is called the <b>LSET</b> representation.
      Assuming we have a universal set of N elements, any set is represented
      by a logical vector of N elements, the I-th element of which is
      TRUE if I is an element of the set.
    </p>

    <p>
      A representation that can be more efficient for small subsets of
      a large universal set is the <b>I4SET</b>.  In this representation,
      we simply list, in ascending order, the elements of the set.
      The representation is simple, but manipulation is more involved.
      For instance, to create the union of two sets, we must determine
      the number of unique elements in the two component sets, allocate
      the necessary space, then interleave the elements of the two 
      components appropriately.
