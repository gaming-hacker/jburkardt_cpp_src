    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMBO</b>,
      a C++ library which
      includes routines for ranking, unranking, enumerating and 
      randomly selecting balanced sequences, cycles, graphs, Gray codes, 
      subsets, partitions, permutations, restricted growth functions, 
      Pruefer codes and trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines are available to count, list, rank and unrank such objects
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>BAL</b>, balanced sequences;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CYCLE</b>, permutations of the first N integers in cycle form;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GRAPH</b>, graphs stored as a list of edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GRAY</b>, Gray codes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>KNAPSACK</b>, optimally filling a knapsack of given size using
          a set of smaller objects;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>KSUBSET</b>, subsets of size exactly K from a set of N objects;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NPART</b>, partitions of an integer having exactly N parts;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PART</b>, partitions of an integer;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PERM</b>, permutations of the first N integers in standard form;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PRUEFER</b>, Pruefer codes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RGF</b>, restricted growth functions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SETPART</b>, partitions of a set;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBSET</b>, subsets of a set of N objects;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>TABLEAU</b>, tableaus;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>TREE</b>, trees;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of these sets of objects can be ordered in several different
      ways, and in some cases, a separate set of ranking, unranking, and
      successor routines are available for the various orderings
      (lexical, colexical, revolving door, Trotter-Johnson).
