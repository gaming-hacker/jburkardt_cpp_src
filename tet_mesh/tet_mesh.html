      <b>TET_MESH</b>,
      a C++ code which
      constructs, describes, or modifies a mesh of tetrahedrons.

      Linear and Quadratic Meshes
    </h3>

    <p>
      The simplest tet mesh, which we term an <i>order 4</i>
      or <i>linear</i> mesh, uses four points to define each tetrahedron.
      A second type of mesh, known as an <i>order 10</i> or <i>quadratic</i>
      mesh, uses ten points.
    </p>

    <p>
      While an order 4 mesh can naturally be constructed directly from
      most sets of data points, a mesh of order 10 is not usually
      constructed directly from the data; at least in the simplest case,
      one wants the 6 extra nodes to be the midpoints of the sides
      determined by the 4 vertices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, an order 10 tet mesh is typically generated in two steps:
      <ul>
        <li>
          generate an order 4 mesh, in which every tetrahedral vertex
          comes from a user data point;
        </li>
        <li>
          generate an order 10 mesh from the order 4 mesh, in which
          the new midside points are not user data points, but rather
          <i>averages</i> of pairs of tetrahedral vertices.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
