      CIRCLE_RULE <br> Quadrature Rules for the Unit Circle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CIRCLE_RULE</b>,
      a C++ library which
      computes quadrature rules 
      over the circumference of the unit circle in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user specifies the value NT, the number of equally spaced angles.  
      The program returns vectors T(1:NT) and W(1:NT), which define the rule Q(f).
    </p>

    <p>
      Given NT and the vectors T and W, the integral I(f) of 
      a function f(x,y) is estimated by Q(f) as follows:
      <pre>
        q = 0.0
        for i = 1, nt
          x = cos ( t(i) )
          y = sin ( t(i) )
          q = q + w(j) * f ( x, y )
        end
      </pre>
