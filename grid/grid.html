      GRID <br> Random Points on a Uniform Grid
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRID</b>,
      a C++ library which
      randomly selects N distinct
      points on a uniform grid in the unit hypercube in M-dimensional space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, unless N is an Mth power of an integer, the program
      must generate a regular grid with too many points, and then omit some.
      Choosing which points to omit is done with a random number generator,
      whose actions are controlled by SEED.
    </p>

    <p>
      The actual placement of the grid within the unit hypercube
      leaves some options for the use.  It is easiest to describe the
      options in the 1 dimensional case, and in terms of where the
      first and last grid point are.  Assuming we have N evenly spaced
      points to place between 0 and 1, the centering options are
      <ul>
        <li>
          CENTER = 1: first point is 0.0, last point is 1.0;
        </li>
        <li>
          CENTER = 2: first point is 1/(N+1), last point is N/(N+1);
        </li>
        <li>
          CENTER = 3: first point is 0, last point is (N-1)/N;
        </li>
        <li>
          CENTER = 4: first point is 1/N, last point is 1;
        </li>
        <li>
          CENTER = 5: first point is 1/(2*N), last point is (2*N-1)/(2*N);
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
