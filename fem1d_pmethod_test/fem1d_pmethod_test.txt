  Solve the two-point boundary value problem

  - d/dX (P dU/dX) + Q U  =  F

  on the interval [-1,1], with
  U(-1) = U(1) = 0.

  The P method is used, which represents U as
  a weighted sum of orthogonal polynomials.


  Highest degree polynomial to use is 2
  Number of points to be used for output = 10

  Problem #2:
  U=cos(0.5*pi*x),
  P=1,
  Q=0,
  F=0.25*pi*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x)
