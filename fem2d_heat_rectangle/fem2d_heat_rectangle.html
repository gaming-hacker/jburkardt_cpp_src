      FEM2D_HEAT_RECTANGLE <br>
      Finite Element Solution in 2D <br>
      Time Dependent Heat Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT_RECTANGLE</b>,
      a C++ program which
      solves the time-dependent 2D heat equation
      using the finite element method in space, and a method of
      lines in time with the backward Euler approximation for the
      time derivative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is a rectangle, with homogenous Dirichlet
      boundary conditions applied along the boundary.  The state variable
      U(X,Y,T) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        Ut - ( Uxx + Uyy ) = F(x,y,t)  in the box;
                  U(x,y,t) = G(x,y,t) for (x,y) on the boundary;
                  U(x,y,t) = H(x,y,t) for t = t_init.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is first covered with an NX by NY
      rectangular array of points, creating (NX-1)*(NY-1) subrectangles.
      Each subrectangle is divided into two triangles, creating a total
      of 2*(NX-1)*(NY-1) geometric "elements".  Because quadratic basis
      functions are to be used, each triangle will be associated not only
      with the three corner nodes that defined it, but with three extra
      midside nodes.  If we include these additional nodes, there are
      now a total of (2*NX-1)*(2*NY-1) nodes in the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now assume that, at any fixed time <t>b</b>, the unknown function
      U(x,y,t) can be represented as a linear combination of the basis
      functions associated with each node.  The value of U at the boundary
      nodes is obvious, so we concentrate on the NUNK interior nodes where
      U(x,y,t) is unknown.  For each node I, we determine a basis function
      PHI(I)(x,y), and evaluate the following finite element integral:
      <pre>
        Integral ( Ux(x,y,t) * dPHIdx(I)(x,y) + dUdy(x,y,t) * dPHIdy(I)(x,y) ) =
        Integral ( F(x,y,t) * PHI(I)(x,y)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The time derivative is handled by the backward Euler approximation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program allows the user to supply two routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>rhs ( x, y, time )</b> returns the right hand side
          F(x,y,time) of the heat equation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>exact_u ( node_num, node_xy, time, u_exact )</b>
          returns the exact solution <b>U_EXACT</b> evaluated at each of
          the <b>NODE_NUM</b> points whose coordinates are stored in
          <b>NODE_XY(1:2,1:NODE_NUM)</b>, at time <b>TIME</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a few variables that are easy to manipulate.  In particular,
      the user can change the variables NX and NY in the main program,
      to change the number of nodes and elements.  The variables (XL,YB)
      and (XR,YT) define the location of the lower left and upper right
      corners of the rectangular region, and these can also be changed
      in a single place in the main program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      Unfortunately, for values of NX and NY over 10, the plot is
      too cluttered to read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
