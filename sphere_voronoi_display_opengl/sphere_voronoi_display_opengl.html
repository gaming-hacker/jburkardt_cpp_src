      SPHERE_VORONOI_DISPLAY_OPENGL <br> Display an Approximate Voronoi Diagram on a Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_VORONOI_DISPLAY_OPENGL</b>,
      a C++ code which
      picks random points on a sphere as generators, and then gradually
      colors in neighboring points according to the color of the nearest generator.
      This, in effect, constructs a Voronoi diagram, or at least, suggests it.
      The exact calculation of the boundary lines and vertices requires
      a more precise computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user is allowed to request the number of generators, and OpenGL is used
      to display the results.  Initially, the sphere is rotating, but at least on
      my machine, once I try to display the neighbors, the rotation becomes very
      slow.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sphere_voronoi_display_opengl</b> <i>gen_num</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>gen_num</i> is the number of generators,
        </li>
      </ul>
      The first 5 or 6
      mouse clicks rotate and pause the image of the generators.  The next 20
      mouse clicks pause the sphere, add 1/10 of the sample points and resume
      rotation.
