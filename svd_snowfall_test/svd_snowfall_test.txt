SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST
  C++ version
  Test the SVD_SNOWFALL library.

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST01
  Read, process, and return snowfall data in "snowfall.txt".

  Number of data rows    M = 10
  Number of data columns N = 129

  Data has been read from the file.

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST02
  Look at the singular values.
  If the singular values are close, then the data is
  well spread out.  If the singular values decay rapidly,
  then the data exhibits patterns, or is constrained to
  a lower-dimensional subspace.

  The singular values:

         0:        22306.9
         1:          672.5
         2:        240.764
         3:        179.584
         4:        148.676
         5:        132.003
         6:          86.53
         7:        38.8972
         8:        24.2869
         9:        9.98088

  Created data file "singular_values_data.txt".
  Created command file "singular_values_commands.txt".

  The cumulative energy:

         0:              0
         1:       0.998812
         2:        0.99972
         3:       0.999836
         4:       0.999901
         5:       0.999946
         6:       0.999981
         7:       0.999996
         8:       0.999999
         9:              1
        10:              1

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST03
  Compute the rank 1 through rank 5 approximations to the data.
  Compare each of these to the 2012 snowfall data.
  Created data file "approx_data.txt".
  Created command file 'approx_commands.txt'.

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST04
  Look at the first 6 modes in the U matrix.
  Each of these represents a pattern for snowfall over a year.
  The first mode is the pattern that is strongest in the data.
  Created data file "umode_data.txt".
  Created command file 'umode_commands.txt'.

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST05
  Look at the first 6 modes in the V matrix.
  Each of these represents a pattern shared by all the months,
  and extending across the 123 sampling years.
  Created data file "vmode_data.txt".
  Created command file 'vmode_commands.txt'.

SVD_SNOWFALL_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
