PYRAMID_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a quadrature rule for approximating
  the integral of a function over a pyramid.

  The user specifies:

  LEGENDRE_ORDER, the order of the Legendre rule for X and Y.
  JACOBI_ORDER, the order of the Jacobi rule for Z,
  FILENAME, the prefix of the three output files:

    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  The requested Legendre order of the rule is 2

  The requested Jacobi order of the rule is 4

  Creating quadrature files.

  "Root" file name is   "pyramid_l2x2_j4".

  Weight file will be   "pyramid_l2x2_j4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "pyramid_l2x2_j4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "pyramid_l2x2_j4_r.txt".

PYRAMID_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
