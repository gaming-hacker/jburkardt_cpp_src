  Compiled on Mar 20 2020 at 17:23:37.

  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Jacobi
  quadrature rule by integrating weighted
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.

  The quadrature file rootname is "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5".

  The requested maximum monomial degree is = 5

JACOBI_EXACTNESS: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check = 5
  Exponent of (1-x), ALPHA = 0.5
  Exponent of (1+x), BETA  = 1.5

  Spatial dimension = 1
  Number of points  = 2

  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Jacobi rule
  ORDER = 2
  ALPHA = 0.5
  BETA  = 1.5

  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) (1-x)^alpha (1+x)^beta f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).

  Weights W:

  w[ 0] =       0.6369718619318372
  w[ 1] =       0.9338244648627008

  Abscissas X:

  x[ 0] =      -0.2742918851774317
  x[ 1] =       0.6076252185107651

  Region R:

  r[ 0] =                       -1
  r[ 1] =                        1

  A Gauss-Jacobi rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree = 3
