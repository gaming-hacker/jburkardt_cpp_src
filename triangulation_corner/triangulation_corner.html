      TRIANGULATION_CORNER <br> Handle triangulation corners.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_CORNER</b>,
      a C++ code which
      tries to correct situations in which a triangulation includes
      corner triangles, that is, triangles which have two sides on boundary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially in finite element settings, such a triangle is considered
      undesirable.  Especially in the case when a linear (order 3) finite
      element is involved, the function approximation in the interior of
      the triangle will be entirely determined by boundary data.  If, for
      instance, the solution is constrained to be zero on the boundary,
      then the finite element function will be zero throughout the interior
      of the corner triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presumably, the triangle has a neighbor triangle on the one non-boundary
      side.  It is generally possible and reasonable to replace these two triangles
      but another two which fill the same quadrilateral, but which are separated
      by the other diagonal of the quadrilateral.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial situation at the corner is suggest by the following diagram:
      <pre>
          |/  |/
          A---C--
          |\  |\
          | \ |
          |  \|
          B---D--
      </pre>
    <p>

    <p>
      By rearranging the corner triangle and its neighbor, we have the more
      satisfactory triangulation:
      <pre>
          |/  |/
          A---C--
          |  /|\
          | / |
          |/  |
          B---D--
      </pre>
    </p>
