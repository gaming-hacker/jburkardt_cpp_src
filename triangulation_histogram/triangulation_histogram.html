    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_HISTOGRAM</b>,
      a C++ code which
      computes the number of points from a dataset that are contained in
      each triangle of a triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      One application of this program is simply to determine whether the dataset
      represents an approximately uniform sampling of the region covered by
      the triangulation.
