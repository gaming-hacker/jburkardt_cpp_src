    <p>
      <b>WEDGE_FELIPPA_RULE</b>,
      a C++ code which 
      generates quadrature rules to estimate integrals
      over the interior of the unit wedge in 3D.
    </p>

     <p>
      The interior of the unit wedge in 3D is defined by the constraints:
      <pre>
        0 <= X
        0 <= Y
             X + Y <= 1
       -1 <= Z <= +1
